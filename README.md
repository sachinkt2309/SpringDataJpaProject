# SpringDataJpaProject

Spring Boot-based web application focused on Corporates-BO-FO (Corporates Management System).

The project "Corporates-BO-FO" BO(Back-Office) FO(Front-Office) is a Spring Boot-based web application focused on Corporates Management System. It involves managing corporate related,Account related data and providing an interface to interact with that data. The project uses Spring Boot's various starter dependencies to simplify the development process, including data persistence with Spring Data JPA, web interactions with Spring MVC, and security features with Spring Security.

## Technologies/Tools used:
- Java 1.8
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- Spring Security 
- Hibernate
- MySQL database
- JSP
- Apache Tomcat
- Eclipse IDE
## Features
- Corporate Management: The core feature of the application involving CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing Corporates and there account information.
- Back Office: The application were only admin have access. Admin could add, view, edit, and delete corporate related and account related records.
- Front Office: The application were Corporate can view there personal details, account details and request for some data changes.
- User Authentication and Authorization: The integration of Spring Security suggests that the application will have user authentication and authorization mechanisms. Users may need to log in to access certain parts of the application or perform specific actions.
- Data Validation: The use of the Spring Boot Starter Validation indicates that the application will likely perform validation on user input to ensure data integrity and prevent errors.
- Database Interaction: The project uses Spring Data JPA, so it's likely that the application will interact with a MySQL database to store and retrieve debtor information.
- Web Interface: The Spring Boot Starter Web dependency suggests that the application will have a web-based user interface. Users could interact with the application through a browser.
- View Rendering with JSP: The integration of Apache Tomcat Jasper and JSTL hints that the project use JavaServer Pages (JSP) for rendering dynamic views. This includes displaying debtor information in a user-friendly format.
- Testing: The inclusion of the Spring Boot Starter Test and Spring Security Test implies that the project have a suite of unit tests and integration tests to ensure the correctness of its features.
- Security: Spring Security integration implies that the application may enforce access control and secure endpoints based on user roles.
## Backend Work
- Entity Creation: Define JPA entities representing the corporate information and account information that needs to be stored in the database. An entity might include fields like Corporate: corporate ID, name, contact information, company, etc.. for account: corporate ID, Account number, branch, type, balance, etc.
- Repository Setup: Create Spring Data JPA repositories for performing CRUD operations on entities. These repositories will provide methods for interacting with the database, such as saving, querying, updating, and deleting records.
- Service Layer: Implement service classes that encapsulate the business logic for managing corporates information and accounts information. Services could handle data validation, business rules, and interactions between the controller and repository layers.
- Controller Implementation: Create Spring MVC controllers to handle HTTP requests and map them to appropriate service methods. Define endpoints for adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving records.
- User Authentication and Authorization: Configure Spring Security to manage user authentication and authorization. Define user roles and permissions, and ensure that only authorized users can access specific endpoints for example: admin can access back-office and front-office but corporates can access only front-office.
- Input Validation: Implement validation logic using annotations or custom validators to ensure that user input is valid and meets the required criteria before performing any database operations.
- Database Configuration: Configure the application to connect to the MySQL database, specifying database connection properties such as URL, username, and password in the application.properties or application.yml file.
- Testing: Write unit tests for service methods and controllers using testing frameworks like JUnit or TestNG. Create integration tests to ensure that components interact correctly and that the database operations work as expected.
- Data Security: Implement security measures to protect sensitive data. Consider encrypting sensitive data like passwords before storing them in the database.
- Logging: Integrate logging to record important events, errors, and activities within the application. Use a logging framework like Log4j or Logback.
- Deployment: Prepare the application for deployment by configuring the appropriate deployment environment, such as setting up the application server and database server. Package the application into a JAR or WAR file.
